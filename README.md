# ASCII and Pose Bone Renamer

**ASCII and Pose Bone Renamer** is a lightweight, portable tool designed to simplify bone renaming in XNALara/XPS models. It is especially useful for 3D models using the `.ascii` format and pose files in the `.pose` format.

🆕 **This is the All-in-One version**, which combines and extends features previously found in the earlier *XPS Pose Renamer* (focused only on `.pose`). Now with added support for `.ascii` models and more robust options.
